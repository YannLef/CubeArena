# CubeArena
Processing project that I made for fun and moreover to learn more about this language.

The game is a 1V1 game where players have to play on the same keyboard.

-> The goal is to push your opponent out of the map in order to win <-

Each player controls a square:
-> Player 1 must use the arrows on his keyboard to make his cube move.
-> Player 2 must use " Z Q S D " on his keyboard to make his cube move.

Food is appearing anywhere in the map, whenever a cube eat food, it grows and earn power.
This energy is essential because the biggest cube is able to push his opponent, while the contrary isn't possible !!

I hope you'll have fun playing it, I personally had a lot while programming it :)
